<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The BAM team were sick and tired of the old return experience where you had to walk over to the post office or the store to drop off your return ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±. We came up with a brand new way to handle returns! Using an uber-model, paired with the current domain, we promise to deliver amazing results ðŸ§¢.
